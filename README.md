# DevCore-Support-Bot

## Bot Description
DevCore Labs is an AI-powered technical resolution system that simulates Level-3 support by analyzing user-reported issues, ticket categories, and attached logs or screenshots to deliver precise, solution-oriented guidance. It leverages OpenRouter to route requests across multiple advanced AI and vision models (including Gemini, LLaMA, and Qwen), allowing dynamic model selection based on problem type, speed, and reasoning needs. The system intelligently adapts responses for hardware, software, network, security, and account-related issues, using contextual conversation memory and evidence-based analysis to provide accurate, professional troubleshooting and product-specific resolutions in real time.
